# MuTime for Android

![MuTime](mutime.png "MuTime for Android")

NTP client for Android. Calculate the date and time "now" impervious to manual changes to device clock time.

In certain applications it becomes important to get the real or "true" date and time.
On most devices, if the clock has been changed manually,
then a `new Date()` instance gives you a time impacted by local settings.

Users may do this for a variety of reasons, like being in different timezones, 
trying to be punctual by setting their clocks 5 â€“ 10 minutes early, etc.
Your application or service may want a date that is unaffected by these changes and reliable as a source of truth. MuTime gives you that.

You can read more about the use case in Instacart's [blog post](https://tech.instacart.com/truetime/).

In a [recent conference talk](https://vimeo.com/190922794), 
instacart explained how the full NTP implementation works with Rx.
Check the [video](https://vimeo.com/190922794) and

# Reason For Fork

[I](https://github.com/medavox/) needed a way of providing reliable time for an app I'm working on,
preserving the correct time across 1) android clock adjustments by the user and 2) device reboots.
Although the NTP client implementation in [TrueTime](https://github.com/instacart/truetime-android)'s
library is more sophisticated than Google's hidden Android 
[SntpClient](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.1.1_r1/android/net/SntpClient.java/),
I needed even more reliable time-keeping for my use case. It was also apparent (at the time of forking)
that [instacart](https://github.com/instacart)/[Kaushik Gopal](https://github.com/kaushikgopal)'s
plans for future development did not fit with my own needs 
(judging from [development branches](https://github.com/instacart/truetime-android/tree/kg/fix/sync_to_atomic)).

## Differences From Upstream

MuTime implements a more 'stubborn' 
[`Persistence`](https://github.com/medavox/MuTime/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/medavox/library/mutime/Persistence.java) 
solution, which preserves information about the correct time even after clock changes and device reboots.
It's a beefed-up version of TrueTime's Disk Cache functionality.

The public API has been revamped somewhat (and the underlying codebase largely rewritten),
to improve maintainability (in my humble opinion).


# How is the true time calculated?

It's pretty simple actually. We make a request to an NTP server that gives us the actual time.
We then establish the delta between device uptime and uptime at the time of the network response.
On each subsequent request for the true time "now", we compute the correct time from that offset.

Once we have this offset information, it's valid until the next time you boot your device.
This means if you enable the disk caching feature, after a single successful NTP request you can
use the information on disk directly without ever making another network request.
This applies even across application kills which can happen frequently if your users have a memory starved device.

# Installation

We use [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io) to host the library.

Add this to your application's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}

dependencies {
    // ...
    compile 'com.github.medavox.mutime:library-extension-rx:<release-version>'

    // or if you want the vanilla, SNTP-only version of Mutime:
    compile 'com.github.medavox.mutime:library:<release-version>'
}
```

# Usage

## Vanilla version

```java
MuTime mu = MuTime.getInstance(ctx);//initialise our singleton

boolean doWeKnowWhatTheRealTimeIsYet = MuTime.hasTheTime();//false -- no!
//calling mu.now() or mu.nowAsDate() at this point would cause a MissingTimeDataException

mu.requestTimeFromServer("time.google.com");//use any ntp server address here, eg "time.apple.com"
boolean doWeKnowTheTimeNow = MuTime.hasTheTime();//true -- yes!

//get the real time in unix epoch format (milliseconds since midnight on 1 january 1970)
try {
    long theActualTime = mu.now();//throws MissingTimeDataException if we don't know the time
}
catch (Exception e) {
    Log.e("MuTime", "failed to get the actual time:+e.getMessage());
}
```

`requestTimeFromServer(String)` must be run on a background thread. 
If you run it on the main (UI) thread, you will get a
[`NetworkOnMainThreadException`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/NetworkOnMainThreadException.html)


## Rx Version

If you use the [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) version then we go all the way 
and implement the full NTP. Use the nifty `initializeRx()` method which takes an 
[NTP pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_pool) server host.

```java
MuTimeRx.build()
        .initializeRx("time.google.com")
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
        .subscribe(date -> {
            Log.v(TAG, "MuTime was initialized and we have a time: " + date);
        }, throwable -> {
            throwable.printStackTrace();
        });
```

Now, as before:

```java
try {
    long theActualTime = mu.now();//throws MissingTimeDataException if we don't know the time
}
catch (Exception e) {
    Log.e("MuTime", "failed to get the actual time:+e.getMessage());
}
```

### What is nifty about the Rx version?

* Implements the full NTP, as opposed to the more basic SNTP (read: far more accurate time)
* The NTP pool address you provide is resolved into multiple IP addresses
* We query each IP multiple times, guarding against checks, and take the best response
* If any of the requests fail, we retry that failed request (alone) for a specified number of times
* We collect all the responses and again filter for the best result as per the NTP spec

## Notes/tips:

* Each `requestTimeFromServer(String)` call makes an SNTP network request.
MuTime needs to do this only once -- barring any , if you use MuTime's `withSharedPreferences`
* Preferably use dependency injection (like [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/)) and create a MuTime @Singleton object
* You can read up on Wikipedia the differences between [SNTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#SNTP) and [NTP](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/faq/faq_37.htm).

## Troubleshooting/Exception handling:

When you execute the MuTime initialization, you are very likely to get an `InvalidNtpServerResponseException` because of root delay violation or root dispersion violation the first time.
This is an expected occurrence as per the [NTP Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905) and needs to be handled.

### Why does this happen?

The NTP protocol works on [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol): 

> It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network and so there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection
>
> UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or is *performed in the application*, avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets, which may not be an option in a real-time system

([Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol), emphasis our own)

This means it is highly plausible that we get faulty data packets. These are caught by the library and surfaced to the API consumer as an `InvalidNtpServerResponseException`. See this [portion of the code](https://github.com/medavox/truetime-android/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/instacart/library/truetime/SntpClient.java#L141) for the various checks that we guard against.

These guards are *extremely* important to guarantee accurate time and cannot be avoided.

If MuTime fails to initialise (because of the above exception being thrown), then a 
[`MissingTimeDataException`](https://github.com/medavox/MuTime/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/medavox/library/mutime/MissingTimeDataException.java)
 is thrown if you try to request an actual date via `MuTime.now()`.

### How do I handle or protect against this in my application?

It's pretty simple:

* Keep retrying the request, until you get a successful one. Yes it does happen eventually :)
* Try picking a better NTP pool server. In our experience `time.apple.com` has worked best

Or if you want the library to just handle that, use the Rx-ified version of the library (note the -rx suffix):

```
    compile 'com.github.instacart.truetime-android:library-extension-rx:<release-version>'
```

With MuTimeRx, we go the whole nine yards and implement the complete NTP Spec.

We:-

* resolve the DNS for the provided NTP host to single IP addresses,
* shoot multiple requests to that single IP, 
* guard against the above mentioned checks,
* retry every single failed request,
* filter the best response,
* and persist that to disk.

If you don't use MuTimeRx, you don't get these benefits.
