# NOTICE: THIS LIBRARY IS NOT MAINTAINED

A rewrite into Kotlin was performed in September 2018, and pushed to master in May 2020.

No further maintenance (beyond releasing this work) is planned.

# MuTime for Android

![MuTime](mutime.png "MuTime for Android")

NTP client for Android. Calculate the date and time "now" impervious to manual changes to device clock time.

In certain applications it becomes important to get the real or "true" date and time.
On most devices, if the clock has been changed manually,
then a `new Date()` instance gives you a time impacted by local settings.

Users may do this for a variety of reasons, like being in different timezones, 
trying to be punctual by setting their clocks 5 â€“ 10 minutes early, etc.
Your application or service may want a date that is unaffected by these changes and reliable as a source of truth. MuTime gives you that.

Originally a fork, now a major rewrite of [Instacart's](https://tech.instacart.com/) [TrueTime](https://github.com/instacart/truetime-android) library.

You can read more about the use case in Instacart's [blog post](https://tech.instacart.com/truetime/).

# Installation

We use [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io) to host the library.

Add this to your application's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.medavox:MuTime:v0.7'
}
```

# Usage

## Simple (SNTP) version

```java
//optionally enable the disk cache
MuTime.enableDiskCache(/*Context*/ this);//this is what actually hardens MuTime against clock changes and reboots

MuTime.initialize("time.google.com");//use any ntp server address here, eg "time.apple.com"

//get the real time in unix epoch format (milliseconds since midnight on 1 january 1970)
try {
    long theActualTime = MuTime.now();//throws MissingTimeDataException if we don't know the time
}
catch (MissingTimeDataException e) {
    Log.e("MuTime", "failed to get the actual time:+e.getMessage());
}
```

`initialize(String)` **must be run on a background thread.**
If you run it on the main (UI) thread, you will get a
[`NetworkOnMainThreadException`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/NetworkOnMainThreadException.html)

# How is the true time calculated?

It's pretty simple actually. We:-

* make a request to one or more NTP servers that give us the true time.
    * DNS-resolve the user-provided strings of NTP URLs into 1 or more IP addresses.
    * For each ip address:
        * shoot multiple requests to it (currently 4 times), 
        * establish the delta between device uptime at request-time and response-time.
        * picks the lowest-latency response (if any).
    * pick the response from all the queried IP addresses with the median system clock offset,
    * and persist that to disk.


On each subsequent request for the true time "now", we compute the correct time from that stored offset.

Once we have this offset information, it's valid until you reboot your device or manually change the system clock.
This means if you enable the disk caching feature, after a single successful NTP request you can
use the information on-disk directly without ever making another network request.
This applies even across application kills -- which can happen frequently if a user has a memory starved device.

# Reason For Fork

[I](https://github.com/medavox/) needed a way of providing reliable time for another app,
preserving the correct time across 1) android clock adjustments by the user and 2) device reboots.
Although the NTP client implementation in [TrueTime](https://github.com/instacart/truetime-android)'s
library is more sophisticated than Google's hidden Android 
[SntpClient](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.1.1_r1/android/net/SntpClient.java/),
I needed even more reliable time-keeping for my use case. It was also apparent (at the time of forking)
that [instacart](https://github.com/instacart)/[Kaushik Gopal](https://github.com/kaushikgopal)'s
plans for future development did not fit with my own needs 
(judging from [development branches](https://github.com/instacart/truetime-android/tree/kg/fix/sync_to_atomic)).

## Differences From Upstream

MuTime implements a more 'stubborn' 
[`Persistence`](https://github.com/medavox/MuTime/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/medavox/library/mutime/Persistence.java) 
solution, which preserves information about the correct time even after clock changes and device reboots.
It's a beefed-up version of TrueTime's Disk Cache functionality.

The public API has been revamped, and the underlying codebase largely rewritten,
to improve maintainability (in my humble opinion).

UPDATE May 2020: Kotlin rewrite from September 2018 has been pushed to master.


# Notes/tips:

* You can read up on Wikipedia the differences between [SNTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#SNTP) and [NTP](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/faq/faq_37.htm).

## Troubleshooting/Exception handling:

When you execute the MuTime initialization, you are very likely to get an `InvalidNtpServerResponseException` because of root delay violation or root dispersion violation the first time.
This is an expected occurrence as per the [NTP Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905) and needs to be handled.

### Why does this happen?

The NTP protocol works on [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol): 

> It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network and so there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection
>
> UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or is *performed in the application*, avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets, which may not be an option in a real-time system

([Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol), emphasis our own)

This means it is highly plausible that we get faulty data packets. These are caught by the library and surfaced to the API consumer as an `InvalidNtpServerResponseException`. See this [portion of the code](https://github.com/medavox/truetime-android/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/instacart/library/truetime/SntpClient.java#L141) for the various checks that we guard against.

These guards are *extremely* important to guarantee accurate time and cannot be avoided.

If MuTime fails to initialise (because of the above exception being thrown), then a 
[`MissingTimeDataException`](https://github.com/medavox/MuTime/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/medavox/library/mutime/MissingTimeDataException.java)
 is thrown if you try to request an actual date via `MuTime.now()`.

### How do I handle or protect against this in my application?

It's pretty simple:

* Keep retrying the request, until you get a successful one. Yes it does happen eventually :)
* Try picking a better NTP pool server. In our experience `time.apple.com` has worked best
